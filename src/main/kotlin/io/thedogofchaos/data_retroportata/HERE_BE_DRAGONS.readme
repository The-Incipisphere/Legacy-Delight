This package is home to the shitfuckination that is a
(scuffed) backport of the datapack system to 1.7.10.
(I'm having to recreate a lot of modern minecraft things :pain:)

If ye wish to traverse these files, expect a lot of bullshit, a lot of java.util.Optional instances (for Kotlin-Java interop),
and (probably) manual construction of shit that was never meant to be manually constructed.
